Internet censorship has been implemented in several countries to prevent citizens from accessing information and to suppress discussion of specific topics. This talk presents Infnote, a platform that helps eliminate the problem of sharing content in these censorship regimes. Infnote is a decentralized information sharing system based on blockchain and peer-to-peer network, aiming to provide an easy-to-use medium for users to share their thoughts, insights and views freely without worrying about data tampering and data loss. Infnote provides a solution that is able to work on any level of Internet censorship. Infnote uses multi-chains architecture to support various independent applications or different functions in an application.
